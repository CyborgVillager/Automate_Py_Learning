Basic Info

This respo is mostly about my notes / mini .py creations during my read of Automate The Boring Stuff With Python
created by Al Sweigart

Will be making new .py files & taking notes as reference to be used for a much larger project.
Feel free to check out the notes & learn a bit as well.
